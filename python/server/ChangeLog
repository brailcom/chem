	* chem_reader.py: add support for reading Molfiles (from strings)

	* session.py: the method process_string now requires an additional argument "format"
	that specifies the format of the string. In future some kind of format-guessing might
	be added, but for now we have to be explicit.
	
	* gtk_test_client.py: when a command line argument evaluates to an existing file
	process this file as molfile

	* detail_periodic_table.py: simple python script
	containing information about chemical elements taken from
	several sources.
	
	* chem_reader.py: make use of the information in detail_periodic_table.py

	* chem_reader.py: Work started on non-fake reader.
	The rest modified to use this reader.
	Use naming added to OASA where possible. 
			
	* gtk_test_client.py: drop some debugging output.
	Do not run an extra local session on startup for check purposes.

	When additional argument from command-line is given, use it as
	the input SMILES, otherwise use a default value.

	* error_logger.py: central point for reporting errors and warnings
	to the user

	* README.setup: added info about InChI program installation
