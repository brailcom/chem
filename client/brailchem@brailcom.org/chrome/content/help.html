      <h2>What is Brailchem</h2>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://ict.brailcom.org/brailchem">Brailchem</a> is a tool to
      help blind and visually impaired students to study chemistry.  Visually
      impaired students have to deal with special difficulties during their
      study such as understanding information commonly presented visually
      (e.g. structures of organic molecules) or learning structurally
      complicated relations without using its visual presentation
      (e.g. periodic table of elements).  The purpose of Brailchem is to
      present chemical information using computers in a way accessible to
      blind and visually impaired students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brailchem is developed as a part of
      the <a href="http://ict.brailcom.org">ICT project</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="usage">
      <h2>Usage</h2>
    </a>

    <p>Brailchem contains two subapplications: molecule browser and periodic
      table of elements.  The subapplications can be started from corresponding
      menu items in the <em>Application</em> menu.  If you want, you can run
      each of the applications in one or more separate windows, created from
      the <em>File / New Window</em> menu.
    </p>

    <p>Brailchem is an Internet oriented application.  It consists of two
      parts: a client and a server.  The server, basically invisible to the
      user, provides all chemical data to the client.  The client is dumb and
      does not know anything about chemical elements or molecule structures, it
      is just a presentation tool of data retrieved from the server.  So in
      order to work the client must be connected to Internet and have access to
      a Brailchem server.  One such server is already preset in the application
      and it is used by default; if you would like to use another one, you can
      set it in the client preferences dialog.</p>

    <p>To start using Brailchem, look into its menus, read available help and
      try to use the available subapplications.  All important information
      about current state of the program and performed actions is printed in
      the application window status bar.</p>
      
    <p>For now there is just a single special global command key in
      Brailchem:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Q</code></td><td>Close Brailchem window</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Of course, you can additionally use menu access keys.  Other command
      keys are specific to particular Brailchem subapplications.
    </p>

    <p>The following sections describe the Brailchem subapplications.</p>
    
    <a name="molecule-browser">
      <h2>Molecule Browser Application</h2>
    </a>

    <p>Molecule browser is capable of inspecting molecule structures and
      chemical reactions given in SMILES notation.  The molecule or reaction is
      written into the input box in the application and by pressing the
      attached button the given molecule or a chemical reaction consisting of
      several molecules is inserted in a browsable expanded form.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can write molecule name to the input box instead of a
      SMILES identifier and press the <code>Inspect by molecule name</code>
      button.  If the molecule name is recognized, the corresponding molecule
      is displayed.</p>

    <p>The application works by connecting to the server part of Brailchem and
      asking it for information represented by the given SMILES string.  The
      server tries to identify molecule names and to expand molecules into
      sequences of atoms and <em>fragments</em> connected by bonds.  Fragments
      are well known groups of atoms identified by the server (e.g. carboxyl
      group) which can be represented by a single item rather than an
      unnecessarily complex list of single atoms.</p>

    <p>When a molecule is inspected (for instance <em>acetic acid</em> is
      written as <code>CC(=O)O</code> in SMILES notation), its name, list of
      basic properties (such as summary formula or molecular weight) and
      sequence of atoms and fragments are displayed.  Each atom or fragment
      displays all items connected to it through bonds.  These items can be of
      two kinds: <em>attached elements</em> which connect just to this atom and
      nothing else (so there is no need to jump to them from here to explore
      the molecule structure) and <em>neighbors</em> which can be connected to
      multiple atoms.</p>

    <p>You can navigate through the items by using the
      standard <code>TAB</code> and <code>Shift+TAB</code> Firefox navigational
      keys or by using one of the special application keys:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+A</code></td><td>jump to molecule atoms; using
          this key you can jump from the molecule name directly to the list of
          atoms and fragments without walking through the molecule
          properties</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+N</code></td><td>go to the next atom</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+P</code></td><td>go to the previous atom</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Alt+M</code></td><td>jump to the molecule input box</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Additionally when pressing <code>Enter</code> on any of the attached
      elements or neighbor names, the focus jumps to the referenced
      element.</p>

    <p>If a displayed molecule contains any fragments, a check box is added at
      the end.  This check box can switch between atom groups view, displaying
      fragments instead of certain groups of atoms, and simple atom view,
      displaying just all atoms and no fragments.</p>

    <p>When inspecting a whole chemical reaction rather than a single molecule
      (for instance <code>CC(=O)O.CCO>[H+]>CC(=O)OCC.O</code> in SMILES
      notation), the view is a bit more complex.  First in the page a summary
      of reactants, reagents and products is displayed.  You can
      press <code>Enter</code> on any of the reaction component names to jump
      to the corresponding molecule view.  Then molecules are displayed in the
      same way as when inspecting a single molecule.</p>

    <p>The same command keys are available as in single molecule browsing.  The
      atom movement keys restrict movement just to a current molecule.
      Additional keys are defined to move across the molecules:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Arrow Down</code></td><td>go to the next displayed molecule</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Arrow Up</code></td><td>go to the previous displayed molecule</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+T</code></td><td>jump back to reaction summary</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <a name="periodic-table">
      <h2>Periodic Table Application</h2>
    </a>

    <p>Periodic table provides information about elements, their properties and
      relations.  You can navigate through it using arrow keys while pressing
      the Shift modifier.  Pressing an element button using the Enter key shows
      complete information about the given element. </p>

    <p>For the purpose of easier orientation the periodic table is split
      according to the traditional presentation style in two parts: The main
      periodic table and the table of lanthanoids and actinoids.  You can jump
      into the main table by pressing <kbd>Control+T</kbd> and into the table
      of lanthanoids and actinoids by pressing <kbd>Control+Shift+T</kbd>.

    <p>Summary of basic periodic table command keys:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Shift+arrow keys</code></td><td>navigate through elements of the periodic table</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+T</code></td><td>jump to the main periodic table</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Shift+T</code></td><td>jump to the table of lanthanoids and actinoids</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+E</code></td><td>jump to given element</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>You can limit the periodic table view by using filters.  Filters can
      reduce the set of browsable periodic table elements to only those
      elements which satisfy given criteria based on some of element properties
      (such as group or oxidation number).  You enable filters by specifying
      them in the <em>Filters</em> box below the periodic table.  If you
      specify more than one filter, only those elements which satisfy all the
      given conditions are present in the resulting filtered set.  Defined
      filters can be disabled or enabled using the check box in the filters
      box.</p>

    <p>You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to work with filters:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F dot</code></td><td>go to filters</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F E</code></td><td>go to electronegativity filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F G</code></td><td>go to group filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F O</code></td><td>go to oxidation number filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F S</code></td><td>go to set of elements filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F ?</code></td><td>show currently filtered elements</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>These shortcuts are composed of sequences of several keys.  First press
      the <kbd>Control+F</kbd> key and then the second key.</p>

    <p>A special filter is the <em>Set of elements</em> filter.  You activate
      it by pressing the <samp>Change</samp> button in the <em>Set of
      elements</em> filter.  Then you are directed to the periodic table where
      you can insert or remove elements into or from the custom element set by
      pressing their buttons with the Enter key.  The following additional
      command keys are available during element set selection:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S dot</code></td><td>finish element selection and activate it</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S A</code></td><td>select all currently active elements</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S N</code></td><td>unselect all elements</td></tr>
    </table>
