      <h2>What is Brailchem</h2>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://ict.brailcom.org/brailchem">Brailchem</a> is a tool to
      help blind and visually impaired students to study chemistry.  Visually
      impaired students have to deal with special difficulties during their
      study such as understanding information commonly presented visually
      (e.g. structures of organic molecules) or learning structurally
      complicated relations without using its visual presentation
      (e.g. periodic table of elements).  The purpose of Brailchem is to
      present chemical information using computers in a way accessible to
      blind and visually impaired students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brailchem is developed as a part of
      the <a href="http://ict.brailcom.org">ICT project</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="usage">
      <h2>Usage</h2>
    </a>

    <p>Brailchem contains two subapplications: molecule browser and periodic
      table of elements.  The subapplications can be started from corresponding
      menu items in the <em>Application</em> menu.  If you want, you can run
      each of the applications in one or more separate windows, created from
      the <em>File / New Window</em> menu.
    </p>

    <p>Brailchem is an internet oriented application.  It consists of two
      parts: a client and a server.  The server, basically invisible to the
      user, provides all chemical data to the client.  The client is dumb and
      does not know anything about chemical elements or molecule structures, it
      is just a presentation tool of data retrieved from the server.  So in
      order to work the client must be connected to internet and have access to
      a Brailchem server.  One such server is already preset in the application
      and it is used by default; if you would like to use another one, you can
      set it in the client preferences dialog.</p>

    <p>To start using Brailchem, look into its menus, read available help and
      try to use the available subapplications.  All important information
      about current state of the program and performed actions is printed in
      the application window status bar.</p>
      
    <p>For now there is just a single special global command key in
      Brailchem:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Q</code></td><td>Close Brailchem window</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Of course, you can additionally use menu access keys.  Other command
      keys are specific to particular Brailchem subapplications.
    </p>

    <p>The following sections describe the Brailchem subapplications.</p>
    
    <a name="periodic-table">
      <h2>Periodic Table Application</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      Periodic table provides information about elements, their properties and
      relations.  You can navigate through it using arrow keys while pressing
      the Shift modifier.  Pressing an element button using the Enter key shows
      complete information about the given element.
    </p>

    <p>For the purpose of easier orientation the periodic table is split
      according to the traditional presentation style in two parts: The main
      periodic table and the table of lanthanoids and actinoids.  You can jump
      into the main table by pressing <kbd>Control+T</kbd> and into the table
      of lanthanoids and actinoids by pressing <kbd>Control+Shift+T</kbd>.

    <p>Summary of basic periodic table command keys:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Shift+arrow keys</code></td><td>navigate through elements of the periodic table</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+T</code></td><td>jump to the main periodic table</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+Shift+T</code></td><td>jump to the table of lanthanoids and actinoids</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+E</code></td><td>jump to given element</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>You can limit the periodic table view by using filters.  Filters can
      reduce the set of browsable periodic table elements to only those
      elements which satisfy given criteria based on some of element properties
      (such as group or oxidation number).  You enable filters by specifying
      them in the <em>Filters</em> box below the periodic table.  If you
      specify more than one filter, only those elements which satisfy all the
      given conditions are present in the resulting filtered set.  Defined
      filters can be disabled or enabled using the check box in the filters
      box.
    </p>

    <p>You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to work with filters:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F dot</code></td><td>go to filters</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F E</code></td><td>go to electronegativity filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F G</code></td><td>go to group filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F O</code></td><td>go to oxidation number filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F S</code></td><td>go to set of elements filtering</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+F ?</code></td><td>show currently filtered elements</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>These shortcuts are composed of sequences of several keys.  First press
      the <kbd>Control+F</kbd> key and then the second key.</p>

    <p>A special filter is the <em>Set of elements</em> filter.  You activate
      it by pressing the <samp>Change</samp> button in the <em>Set of
      elements</em> filter.  Then you are directed to the periodic table where
      you can insert or remove elements into or from the custom element set by
      pressing their buttons with the Enter key.  The following additional
      command keys are available during element set selection:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S dot</code></td><td>finish element selection and activate it</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S A</code></td><td>select all currently active elements</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>Control+S N</code></td><td>deselect all elements</td></tr>
    </table>

      <h2>Molecule Browser Application</h2>
    </a>

    <p>Right now this application serves mostly as a proof of concept of
      communication between the client and the server.  This application is in
      development and will change significantly.</p>
