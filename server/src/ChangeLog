2008-05-27   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: support for cis-trans stereochemistry on double bonds added
	* twistd/server.py: type information added to neighbors/link

2008-04-21   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: support for openbabel added to the reader
	* twistd/server.py: upload of files implemented using POST method

	
2008-04-11   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>
	
	* twistd/server.py: priority information was removed from value element

	
2008-04-08   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: added charge information on molecule and atoms
	* twistd/server.py: added priority to data (was set to value only,
	thus data without value did not have priority set).
	
	
2008-04-01   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: added support for SVG generation.

	
2008-03-13   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: added support for querying structures by name;
	added support for fragments;
	name support was changed and uses structure_database instead of
	name_database. This new database is based on pysqlite.
	Setup of this database is described in README.setup

	* twistd/server.py: added support for querying structures by name -
	using address /name/XXX structure with name XXX will be retrieved.
	This functionality requires newest oasa + pysqlite installed
	
	
2008-02-21   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: support for reactions added (only SMILES could produce reactions for now);
	because molecule is not always the top-level node of the structure anymore, "RESULT" was added
	as the top-level with molecules and reactions as its children.

2008-02-18   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* twistd/server.py: serialization of data that appear more than one time in the result changed.
	<ref id="XXX"/> may appear anywhere in the serialized XML to refer to previously serialized data
	with id XXX.

2007-12-08   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: test support for fragments added. It recognizes two types of groups now -
	aldehydic carbonyl groups and carboxylic acids.

2007-11-08   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* twisted/server.py: labels for periodic table localized, silently ignore unsupported languages
	and use english instead
	

2007-11-07   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* locale support: data_types have localized value, localization is done using an "ondemand"
	approach (taken from lcg, http://cvs.freebsoft.org/repository/lcg/)

	* i18n.py: localization support from lcg, small adjustments were made to remove dependency on lcg
	and to support system-wide installation of po-files.
	
	* twisted/server.py: updated to make translation of localizable data on serialization
	
2007-10-31   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* detail_periodic_table.py: rework the language dependent descriptions of elements - they are now given as
	a dictionary lang_code -> description

	* chem_reader.py: make use of the new detail_periodic_table

	
2007-10-04   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* detail_periodic_table.py: rework the language dependent element names - they are now given as
	a dictionary lang_code -> name

	* chem_reader.py: make use of the new detail_periodic_table
	

2007-10-03   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* data_types.py: reorganization of data_type priorities

	* chem_reader.py: read all data from detail_periodic_table, including ROW, COLUMN and group
	

2007-10-02   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* object_types.py: new object_type LanguageDependentValue was introduced

	* chem_reader.py: makes use of LanguageDependentValue for element name and description

	* data_type.py: obsolete data_types NAME_CZ and NAME_EN were removed. New ELEMENT_NAME
	was introduced and NAME_LAT was renamed to LATIN_ELEMENT_NAME


2007-09-18   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* detail_periodic_table.py: new data - ROW, COLUMN, ORBITALS

	* object_types.py: support for view priorities. Priorities are taken
	from default_priority of a data_type

	* data_types.py: add default_priority to data_type objects

2007-09-10   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>
	
	* object_types.py: add text_dump() method to object_types that gives
	either plain or recursive text dump of objects data

	* chem_reader.py: atom objects are now PartMultiView(), not ValuePartMultiView()
	- the Value was redundant, it is one of the views. View priorities should provide
	a similar functionality in the future.
	
	
2007-09-03   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: add support for reading summary formulas (Na2SO4 etc.)
	                  (this does not provide structure of the compound - just a
	                   set of disconnected atoms).
	Add known_formats method that returns a list of all known formats.
	
	
2007-07-30   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: add support for reading Molfiles (from strings)

	* session.py: the method process_string now requires an additional argument "format"
	that specifies the format of the string. In future some kind of format-guessing might
	be added, but for now we have to be explicit.
	
	* gtk_test_client.py: when a command line argument evaluates to an existing file
	process this file as molfile
	
2007-06-29   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* detail_periodic_table.py: simple python script
	containing information about chemical elements taken from
	several sources.
	
	* chem_reader.py: make use of the information in detail_periodic_table.py
	
	
2007-06-12   Beda Kosata <kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* chem_reader.py: Work started on non-fake reader.
	The rest modified to use this reader.
	Use naming added to OASA where possible. 
			
	* gtk_test_client.py: drop some debugging output.
	Do not run an extra local session on startup for check purposes.

	When additional argument from command-line is given, use it as
	the input SMILES, otherwise use a default value.

	* error_logger.py: central point for reporting errors and warnings
	to the user

	* README.setup: added info about InChI program installation
